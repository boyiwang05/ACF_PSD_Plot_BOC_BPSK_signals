# ACF_PSD_Plot_BOC_BPSK_signals

This is a code set that focuses on plotting PSD and ACF of BOC signals or BPSK signals. 
Some of ACFs of unambiguous tracking algorithms are included for previous research purpose.
Please contact to me if you have any other issues.
Please cite this code in your academical paper if you found it is helpful. Thank you.
